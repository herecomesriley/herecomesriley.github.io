            <p class="paragraph">My name is Riley, and I am a pixel artist! You can find some examples of my art here!</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I spent a while looking for a website where I could host my portfolio, but ultimately I decided to make my own.
                Every site had its drawbacks, and I wanted my portfolio to have a few specific features, like categories, or just the ability to have some text accompany my art.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">And, to be completely honest, I just found creating this place fun.</p>

There are black and white orbs floating in the background. ">

                    <h3>Luna & Eclipse</h3>
                    <p>What started as an attempt at making an avatar for myself, to represent me on various social media sites, eventually became my first and only to date character that I designed entirely on my own.</p>
                    <p>The original depiction of them was created in October of 2024, and for a few months it would stay as the only image of them. In February 2025 I finished a more complete design, visible on the second image.</p>
                    <p>I love how the initial design came out, but it is not without its flaws. Admittedly, the shirt was rather rushed. As will be visible on the WIP images below, at first, they were supposed to be wearing a jacket.
                        Ultimately, however, I decided to scrap that idea, as I liked the look of the plain black shirt more. The downside of that was that it was, well, plain, uninteresting. I tried salvaging it, and in many ways I have succeeded,
                        but I could not see how it would work with the complete design.
                    </p>
                    <p>I will go over some design choices I made along the way in the WIP images section.</p>

            <h3>WIP images</h3>

            <div class="grid-container">

                    <img class="art-3" src="art/wip/luna_bust_1.jpg">

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Originally, Luna was supposed to wear a denim jacket and have much darker green hair. As mentioned, I removed the jacket rather early on in the process, as I liked how they looked without it better.
                        The hair becoming brighter and more vibrant was a bit of a happy accident. I originally did not intend for this, but during shading I made it pop much more than I anticipated, but I loved that look,
                        so I decided to keep it.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="grid-container">

                    <img class="art-3" src="art/wip/luna_card_shirt_1.png">

                <div>
                    <p>Above are some iterations of the top piece for the character. As said above, I was not quite happy with the one from the original image. I quickly sketched out some ideas I had, and eventually decided
                        to go with the last one, mainly because it was the best at conveying the idea I had for Luna, while also not being overly complicated.

                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>Eclipse, the shadow counterpart to Luna, also went through a couple of drastic changes. At first, I wanted them to wear a suit, however, I quickly realized that a black suit would blend in too much on a character, 
                        whose body is pure black. I considered changing the color of the suit, but then that color would the pure black of the body, which was out of the question, since keeping the shadow aesthetic was the top priority for me.
                        Eventually, I decided to scrap the idea and try something else, something simpler.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another major change was the decision to use a 1-bit color palette for Eclipse. I was having trouble creating enough contrast when adding shading, so I decided to use a color palette consisting of only two colors.
                        This has not only made the piece much clearer, but it also further helped sell the aesthetic of a "shadow person".
